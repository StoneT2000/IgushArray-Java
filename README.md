# IgushArray-Java WIP
 An implementation of the [IgushArray](https://github.com/igushev/IgushArray) in Java, with `O(1)` access and `O(N^1/2)` insertion and removal



The java implementation of the IgushArray is a one for one replacement for an ArrayList as it implements the same interfaces as ArrayList, namely **Iterable<E>, Collections<E>, List<E>, RandomAccess**
